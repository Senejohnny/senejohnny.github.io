I am a Senior Data Scientist and Certified Analytics Translator with a PhD in Applied Mathematics and a foundation in Electrical Engineering. My career has been driven by a fascination with complex systems—leading me to solve high-stakes challenges across manufacturing, cybersecurity, healthcare, and finance.

Currently, I lead a cross-functional team at ABN AMRO Private Banking & Wealth. 
We bridge the gap between technical engineering and strategic goals, collaborating closely with Marketing, Sales, Product, and Segment Development teams.
Together, we deliver AI-driven solutions that transform how the bank approaches mortgages, investments, and financial planning.
